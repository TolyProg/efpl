# Educational functional programming language (EFPL)
## WIP! This is originally a school project (and it's a terrible one)

## Goal
As a school project, the goal was reached, but now I want MORE.

The goal is to provide specs and implementations that I can (hopefully) use to code *everything I want* in this language (including stuff like OSes, userlands, web-browsers, etc.).

## About progress
Current priority is the C transpiler branch, master is abandoned

Interpreter in this branch is functional, but terribly inefficient (no optimizations whatsoever!)

The language has no strict syntax (at least for now), but grammar draft is in the source code (efpl.py) in EBNF. The syntax will evolve (i think)

Branches:
- **master (this one): the interpreter (abandoned & outdated)**
- C_transpiler: idk wut it is (currently under active development)
